# 🪙 Hyper Sats (hSAT)

> 1 satoshi = 1 hSAT.  
> Bitcoin’s smallest unit — on Hyperliquid EVM.

## 🖤 What the F**k Is This?

**Hyper Sats (hSAT)** is a fully trustless ERC-20 that wraps sats on-chain.  
Mint by sending uBTC. Liquidity gets locked. Forever.

No presale. No VC allocations. No whitelist.  
Just raw code, hard limits, and a maxxed-out meme.

---

## ⚙️ Mechanics

- 🧱 **1 uBTC base unit = 1 hSAT**
- 🔥 Minting auto-adds liquidity, **burns LP**, and sends you your stack
- 🧊 LP tokens go straight to `address(0)` — **forever locked**
- 💸 **1% transfer tax** — recycled into the LP via auto-swap and burn
- 🧼 **Transfers are disabled** until supply is maxed — **snipers get zero access**

## 🧠 Built for Decentralized Maxis

| Feature           | Status                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| LP Ownership      | 🔥 Burned forever                      |
| Contract Ownership| 🧼 Used only to toggle tax             |
| Max Supply        | ✅ 100,000,000 hSAT (1:1 sats)         |
| Mint Ratio        | 💯 1 base unit of uBTC = 1 hSAT        |
| Transfer Tax      | 🔁 1% → swapped, LP'd, and burned      |

## 📉 Supply & Liquidity

- **Total Supply**: `100,000,000` hSAT — same as total Bitcoin sats
- **LP grows with every mint**, priced in uBTC
- **LP tokens burned on mint + tax recycle**
- **No inflation. No unlocks. No bullshit.**

---

## 🧬 Why It Slaps

- No founders. No airdrops. No fake decentralization.

- **Liquidity can only go up** — tax adds, nobody removes

- Built for those who respect **final supply** and **zero trust**

---

## 🚷 Anti-Bot Design

Transfers are **disabled** until the full supply is minted.  
No LP sniping. No MEV. No price distortion.  
Bots can go trade memecoins.

**No permissions. No trust.  
Just Hyperliquid satoshis — locked in deep.**
